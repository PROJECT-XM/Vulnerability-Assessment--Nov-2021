# Vulnerability-Assessment--Nov-2021

The objective of our report was to identify potential vulnerabilities, explain the impact of such vulnerabilties on our subject and provide associated recommendations on how to mitigate the risks and improve their security posture.

We conducted manual scans on the subject's website and intranet firewall through the internet, and categorised the impact of each vulnerability on subject's risk profile as critical, high, medium and low. 

For this assessment, our scans and research methodology are categorised as follows:

- Reconnaissance
  - Active scanning
  - Gather victim host information
  - Gather victim identity information
  - Gather victim network information
  - Gather victim organisation information
  - Search open technical databases
  - Search open websites/domains

- Initial access
  - Eg. admin username for Company's Wordpress site  

- Execution
  - Command and scripting interpreter
  - Exploitation for Client Execution (attempted)

- Defense evasion
  - Eg. slow scan to prevent detection

Examples of found vulnerabilities include outdated plugins connected to published CVEs.
